```

## Shut down CSM Server

```shell
$ cd /usr/local/csm/csmserver
$ ./csmserver stop
```

## Edit csmserver launch script and database.ini

If you have previously made modifications to csmserver launch script (e.g. use a different python interpreter) or database.ini (e.g. use different username and password to connect to the database), you will need to make the same changes here.

```shell
$ vi /usr/local/csm-master/csmserver/csmserver
$ vi /usr/local/csm-master/csmserver/database.ini
```

## Switch to the latest code

Rename the current CSM Server directory to csm_old and the csm-master to csm.  

```shell
$ cd /usr/local
$ mv csm csm_old              
$ mv csm-x.x csm
```

### Restart CSM Server

```shell
$ cd /usr/local/csm/csmserver
$ ./csmserver start
```

### Restart CSM Server - inside a virtual environment

Copy the virtual environment directory (e.g. env) which contains python interpreter and library modules, to the new application directory.

```shell
$ cd /usr/local/csm/csmserver
$ cp â€“R /usr/local/csm_old/csmserver/env .
$ source env/bin/activate
